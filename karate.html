            <li> <a href="https://www.southfieldmartialarts.com/html/history_isshinryu.html">Isshin-Ryu (One-Heart) Karate</a> is an Okinawan martial arts style that was created around the time when World War II ended. </li>
            <li> It's influenced by many other types of karate, like Goju-Ryu and Shorin-Ryu. </li>

        <li>What I've gained from Karate</li>
        <ul>
            <li> I've learned how to be a leader, by leading some karate classes. </li>
            <li> Karate is also a useful stress-coping mechanism, as I pretending that stress is a person when sparring with others. </li>
            <li> Becoming good at something takes time, and I've learned that from practicing daily. </li>
